# Laboratory Work No.6


## Purpose

- Developing using C#

- WinRT


## Requirements

#### Mandatory Objectives

- Create an __Win32__ or __WinRT__ application using C#

- Choose one of:

   + Convert a previous laboratory work to C#

   + Create a ToDo list. Should contain:

      - A list of tasks
      
      - A way to add new tasks from UI


#### Objectives with Points

- Create a report `(3 pt)`

- Use WinRT `(3 pt)`

- Create a pull request with a meaningful fix/feature to 5th WP laboratory work of your colleagues. It should be a project in which you were not involved. `(4 pt)`



## Implementation

- I chose to recreate [Laboratory Work No.1](https://github.com/skidne/WinProgLabs/tree/master/lab%231) in C#

- It's the exact copy of it, so the main functionalities and features are described in there

       
## Conclusions

In this laboratory work we learnt (or should've learnt):

- what's _WinRT_

- how time-consumming is C++ compared to C#
